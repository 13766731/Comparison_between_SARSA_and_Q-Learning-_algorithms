Abstrac:

Processes and systems are continually subjected to fault or malfunctions because of age or sudden events, which might degrade the operation performance and even result in operation failure that is a vital issue in the safety essential system. Therefore, it is actuated to develop a Fault-Tolerant Control strategy so that the system will operate with tolerated performance degradation. A fascinating property in Fault-Tolerant Controllers is adaptability to system changes as they evolve throughout systems operations. In this paper, we proposed the Reinforcement-based Fault-Tolerant Control (RL-based FTC) methodology while not want of the system model and also the data of fault and we compared between the utilization of Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms in Fault-Tolerant Control strategy. The effectiveness of the two algorithms is demonstrated by the Centrifugal Compressor system by the Python software. Our experiment demonstrates that the Q-learning algorithm primarily based on Fault-Tolerant Control performs better than SARSA algorithmic program based on Fault-Tolerant Control underneath sudden fault.
